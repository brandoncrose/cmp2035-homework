		<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>In a large bowl, toss together shrimp with 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt and baking soda until evenly coated. Let stand for at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour.</li>

				<li>In a <a href="http://www.target.com/p/lodge-cast-iron-pre-seasoned-skillet-12-inch/-/A-10291923#prodSlot=medium_1_1&term=lodge" target="_blank">large skillet</a>, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over high heat until shimmering. Add half the shrimp in an even layer and cook, stirring and turning shrimp occasionally, until pink and barely cooked through and just starting to turn lightly golden in spots, about 2 minutes.</li>

				<li>Using a <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/williams-sonoma-deep-slotted-spoon/" target="_blank">slotted spoon</a>, flexible slotted offset spatula, or tongs, transfer shrimp to a plate. Add 1 more tablespoon olive oil to skillet and reheat until shimmering, and repeat with remaining shrimp.</li>

				<li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet along with garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until garlic is just starting to turn golden, about 1 minute.</li>

				<li>Add vermouth and boil, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfjtpp90lu8" target="_blank">raw alcohol smell</a> is mostly gone and vermouth has reduced by about half, about 3 minutes.</li>

				<li>Add butter and cook, stirring and swirling the pan rapidly as butter melts to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion" target="_blank">silky, emulsified sauce</a>. Remove from heat, add lemon juice, and season with salt. Return to medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. (If sauce breaks, whisk in a teaspoon or two of water until the sauce emulsifies again, as described in our <a href="/videos/frisky-whisking.html">helpful how-to video</a>!)</li>

				<li>Return shrimp to skillet, add herbs and lemon zest and toss until shrimp are coated in sauce and warmed through. Serve immediately.</li></p>
